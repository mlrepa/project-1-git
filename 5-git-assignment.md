# Assignment

## Task

- Create a new `5-git-assignment` branch from `main` branch
- Add a `notebooks/` directory, and set up Git to sure that no Jupyter Notebooks or other files added to `notebooks/` directory get to Git history
- Add a `metrics` directory, and make it keep versions of all files you may put inside
- Push `5-git-assignment` branch to remote repo (your mlrepa course workspace) 
- Create Merge Request to `main` branch


## Expected results

- Create branch has `5-git-assignment` name
- `notebooks/` directory in GitLab has only `.gitignore` file
- New files added to `notebooks/` directory are NOT tracked by Git
- New files added to `metrics/` directory  are added to Git
